# Hotrod

Roboto Studio's open-source, agent-first website starter. Built on [Astro](https://astro.build/) and tailored for sites that are built, edited, and maintained primarily by coding agents.

> Heads up: Hotrod assumes you are driving development through an agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). Conventions, scripts, and project structure are tuned for that workflow rather than hand-editing.

## Getting started

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Project structure

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── authors/
│   │   ├── blog/
│   │   └── pages/
│   ├── content.config.ts
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── styles/
├── astro.config.mjs
└── package.json
```

Static assets live in `public/`. Content lives in `src/content/`. Routes in `src/pages/` query the content collections and render them through the layouts in `src/layouts/`.

## Content

All site content lives under `src/content/` and is validated by strict Zod schemas defined in `src/content.config.ts`.

| Collection | Path | URL pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pages` | `src/content/pages/**/*.mdx` | `/`, `/about`, `/services/astro`, … |
| `blog` | `src/content/blog/*.mdx` | `/blog/[slug]` |
| `authors` | `src/content/authors/*.mdx` | `/authors/[slug]` |

The dev server reflects new entries automatically. Drafts (`draft: true`) render in development but are excluded from production builds.

If you typo a frontmatter key, omit a required field, or reference an author that doesn't exist, the build fails with a clear error. This is intentional — Hotrod is built to be driven by an agent on behalf of a non-technical user, and silent failures are worse than loud ones.

## Commands

All commands run from the project root.

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`    | Install dependencies                         |
| `pnpm dev`        | Start the local dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `pnpm build`      | Build the production site to `./dist/`       |
| `pnpm preview`    | Preview the production build locally         |
| `pnpm astro ...`  | Run Astro CLI commands (`astro add`, `astro check`, etc.) |
